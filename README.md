# Udemy-CapStone-F1-Overview
Part of udemy webdev course. I'm trying to create a webapp that displays current stats in a concise way.
## About This Project

This project is part of the Udemy Complete Web Development Bootcamp. The goal is to create a web application that displays current Formula 1 statistics in a concise and user-friendly way. The primary focus of this project is on learning how to communicate with a public API, rather than creating a clean or responsive design.

## Features

- Fetches real-time Formula 1 data from a public API.
- Displays key statistics in an easy-to-read format.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Udemy-CapStone-F1-Overview.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Udemy-CapStone-F1-Overview
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the app.

## Notes

- This project prioritizes functionality over design. The layout is not optimized for responsiveness or aesthetics.
- Ensure you have an active internet connection, as the app relies on fetching data from a public API.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance the design for better responsiveness.
- Add more detailed statistics and features.
- Improve error handling for API requests.
